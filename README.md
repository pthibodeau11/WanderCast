## About

See the world, attend a live event, or wander a museum through the eyes (well, camera) of your own live-streamer. Simply make a request, and our team will send a streamer the location of your choice.

- **Go anywhere** Our streamers aren't attached to their desktops at home.
- **Private** Our live-streams are private and password protected between you and the streamer.
- **High-quality** Our streamers have been vetted to provide high-quality streams.

## Tech Overview

This is a full-stack application created in just over 2 weeks while attending DevMountain. I used React, Redux, Express, Node, and PostgreSQL as the stack for developing the project. In addition, I learned and implemented Stripe, Firebase cloud storage, Nodemailer, and Google places API into the project.

## Primary features:

-   Create a new account (bycrypt for auth) and edit profile
-   Submit a live-stream request
-   Edit, delete, purchase, or watch live-streams
-   Apply to be a live-streamer
-   Separate admin portal for managing the incoming stream requests and viewing high-level user data
